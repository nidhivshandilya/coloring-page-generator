# 🎨 AI Coloring Page Generator

An interactive web application that generates custom coloring pages using AI. Perfect for parents and teachers! I built this to get hands-on experience with the latest AI tools. The idea for this specific use-case came to me when my son would ask me for bizarre coloring pages (like tsunami, tornado and volcano erupting together) and we'd muck around on google image search to see if someone created something like this. My goal was to learn most of it without spending anything on subscriptions. So, I built this majorly using my mind, Claude free chatbot and Github. Below was my prompt to Claude and it took many iterations to get here. I worked through bug fixes and issue resolutions with Claude as we both tried to get things to work. I learned a good deal and the process was very enjoyable.

**Prompt**: "Help me build a web app that is an on-demand coloring page generator for kids and parents. You simply type in natural language what you'd like to color today and the app creates a page for you that you print. This web app is going to be my open source project that I show on github. It should utilize all free resources - i don't want to pay for anything. You create detailed step by step instructions for me and the end goal is a published web app using github, replit, google gemini"

Obviously, I had to refine my prompt as we iterated - for example change from Gemini to Hugging Face to Puter; or telling Claude again and again to simplify technical instructions like find X in line Y of file Z and replace with this code snippet. Doing this was a wonderful learning itself.
